<h2 style="font-family:Calibri;">About the Game</h2>
<p>The game I created has taken great inspiration from the game "Flappy Bird". Originally I wasn't planning on making it
    this way, however, it seemed to evolve to become this over the development process. Once I had a moving object controlled by the player,
    I started to create other objects with the goal of them moving across the screen incrementally. This then lead to me
    trying to add some kind of randomness to the objects as they spawn.</p>

    <p>This is how the game "Ball Dribble" came to be. The basic goal of the game is to dribble your ball through the blockades
    that are in your way. How long can you last? Try it out now!</p>

    <p>All of the code that I have used here is my own. I have only looked up certain methods such as "setInterval" and
    the "keycode" for the keyboard. I found a very useful website in which you register a key and it will give you back
    the keycode which corresponds to that key. The website can be found <a href="https://keycode.info/"> here</a> </p>


    <p>The only other assets used for this game which aren't my own include the background of the canvas element and the images
    which are used on the Help page. I have given credit to these sources in the footer div at the bottom of the pages in
    which they are used.</p>
