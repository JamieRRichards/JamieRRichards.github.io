    <h3>Game Objectives</h3>
    <p>The objective of the game as the player is to maneuver the ball through the blocks coming towards you. These blocks will randomly
    change shape as you progress through the game. The background simulates you "dribbling" your way across the football pitch and avoiding
        all obstacles that are in your way.</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>The controls for the game are simple. You can either move the ball up or down and there are two different controls for this. You can
        either use the arrow keys up and down: <img src="keyUp.jpg" alt="Keyboard Up Arrow"> <img src="keyDown.jpg" alt="Keyboard Down Arrow">
        or you can use the other keys I included: <img src="keyW.jpg" alt="Keyboard W Key"> <img src="keyS.jpg" alt="Keyboard S Key"></p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
